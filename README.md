# edX_UCSD_MicroMaster_Algorithms_DataStructure

This project is designed to archive all the programming assignments toward completing the MicroMaster Program of Algorithms and Data Structure provided by The University of California, San Diego and edX.

Still on progress, and the expected completion time is the end of 2020.

I mainly use c++ or python, depending on type of the question.

Caution: Please keep in mind the course's policy on academic honesty is strict and do not copy and paste part or whole of codes in this project for your own assignments. Reference only and not guaranteed to be accurate or optimal solution.
